### Similar image retrival

Drawing inspiration from Fr√©chet inception distance[1], I have implemented an algorithm for retrieving similar images based on feature distance. Leveraging Inception V3[2] as the feature extractor, I utilized the Euclidean distance to gauge the dissimilarity between features.

Following [1], feature extraction occurred at the final average pooling layer, while extracting features from other layers is possible.

### Dataset

For the experiments, I randomly selected 500 samples from the wild category images in Animal Faces-HQ (AFHQ)[3]. These images showcase diverse wildlife, including lions, tigers, and wolves.
